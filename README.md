<h2> Goal </h2>
The goal for the Vim Jam was to create a game in ten days that conformed to the topic "Boss", as well as the theme "On the Edge".

<h2> Timeline </h2>
The first couple of days were spent collaborating, coming up with ideas of which we settled on a king who's in purgatory (On the edge between life and death) who has to defeat the devil (boss) to regain his life. The rest of the week was spent on mostly our daily lives, where we either worked or went to school and committed changes where we could.
